#  Jobarchy Flutter App

Jobarchy is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to help users find **genuine job opportunities** through a clean, modern, and scalable architecture.  
The project follows the **MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel)** pattern using **Riverpod** for state management, ensuring modularity, testability, and maintainability for large-scale development — similar to apps like Instagram or LinkedIn.
